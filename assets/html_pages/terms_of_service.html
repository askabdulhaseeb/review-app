<p><b>Photo Guidelines</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking photographs is a scientific art which emerges out the true emotions of the place and time of capture. Here are some tips which can help you in becoming one of the best MyRevue photographers possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Lighting and framing! </b>Make it pretty. People love pretty things.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
    <li><b>Originality! </b>Upload your photos, not somebody else's.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
    <li><b>Keep it appropriate. </b>Though nudity is natural, not everyone wants to see it. The same goes for</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>hateful things, spam, and irrelevant photos. So steer away from naked people, mean-ness, gross-ness, inappropriate-ness and anything else that you wouldn't want to see when you're exploring.</p>
<ol start="4">
    <li><b>Be respectful. </b>Don't take photos that include people's private information, like a credit card number or phone number, and don't upload a photo of anyone who doesn't want their picture uploaded. Think twice: you wouldn't want your private info shared either.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
    <li><b>Be yourself. </b>MyRevue is a community of people, and you're a big part of that. Take photos and have fun.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
    <li><b> Be Cautious: </b>Do not upload images of places of high security and importance, archaeological sites, railways, defence areas, etc. without prior compliance with applicable laws from the concerned government authorities and departments.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and happy photographing!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. If you see something inappropriate, use the "Report Content" option to alert us and we'll take care of things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
